								<p>
									For our third and final group COMP 4461 Project in <b>Darkness will Arise</b>, we were tasked to develop our project surrounding the topic of Social Virtual Reality (VR). Out of the three potential topics, we picked <b><i>"2. Designing Social VR experiences for some other future scenario"</b></i>.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									We decided to build up our project on the idea of <b><i>VR Shopping</i></b>. Online Shopping has shown more dominance as a shopping choice over the years. Despite the massive convenience of being able to shop anywhere, it still has its own handful of inconveniences; the main issue with this mode of shopping is its <b>lack of socialization</b>; When shopping in physical stores, you could often go with your friends and family. But physical shopping has its own set of challenges and limitations for both customers (e.g. Getting Lost) and shopowners (e.g. Rent and Security).
								</p>
																
								<p>
									Because of this, we decided to develop a VR Shopping Platform; Not just to <u>utilize the strengths of physical (e.g. Traditional Charm of Physical Stores) and online stores (e.g. Remote Accessibility)</u>, but also to <u>compensate for their respective weaknesses</u>. On top of that, we decided to <b>integrate our ideas from Project 1 and Project 2 into our Final Project</b>. Our VR Shopping Platform and final project for <b>Darkness will Arise</b> is called <b><i>VeRse</i></b>.
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/verse_logo.png" alt="" style="width:600px;height:600px;"/></p>
								
								<h2><u>What is VeRse?</u></h2>
								
								<p>
									<b><i>VeRse</b></i> is a 24/7 online VR Shopping Platform. With the non-existent limitations of space and physics in the VR world, users can experience the realistic yet boundless galleria of the <b><i>VeRse</b></i>. Not only can users <i><u>shop for tangible goods of various sizes</u></i> (e.g. Clothing, Automobiles, Planes), but they can also <i><u>enjoy intangible services</u></i> (e.g. Cinema, Karaoke, Arcades). To add, no matter where your friends and family are in the real world, they can always be of company while you stroll around with them online in the <b><i>VeRse</b></i>. The endless possibilities and exclusive features available in <b><i>VeRse</i></b> would make it an excellent choice when planning to shop or run a business.
								</p>
								
								<h2><u>Interpret</u></h2>
								
								<p> To further understand our target audience, we've brainstormed potential difficulties and issues they may face in shopping environment, be it physically or through online platforms. 								
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/POV.png" alt="" style="width:800px;height:500px;" /></p>
								
								
								<h2><u>Mindmap</u></h2>
								
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/mindmap_proj3.png" alt="" style="width:1000px;height:1000px;" /></p>
															
																					
								
								<h2><u>Video Storyboard Plot</u></h2>
								<p>
									This is a whiteboard capture of our video's story rundown when first drafting the plot.

								<h2><u>Prototype Video Demonstration</u></h2>
								<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13NgZJKX1Ko6FQaL2MNwpiqFhPHRiJNoL/preview" width="960" height="550"></iframe>
								
								<h2><u>Prototype Illustration</u></h2>
								
								<p> The Prototype Video Demonstration attempts to demonstrate the potential functions and exclusive features available in the <b><i>VeRse</b></i> with a somewhat humorous tone. The overall story follows the first person perspective of <u>Aayush</u> as a regular roamer in our VR platform. We made use of various programs and software to develop the whole video from scratch.<br>

								<h4 style="text-align:left">1. Shopping List</h4>
								<p><b><i>MART-E</b></i> has a Shopping List feature that allows users to plan items to purchase when shopping outside. Apart from the basic user input method, there are 2 other smart methods <b><i>MART-E</b></i> possesses for the Shopping List feature.
								</p>
											

								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/basic.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /><br>Standard Input</p>
								
											
								<h4 style="text-align:left">1A. Specification</h4>
								<p>When users input ambiguous and vague items into the list, <b><i>MART-E</b></i> will ask for clarification and provide several suggestions on what the user meant to add into the list. The user can select one of the options available to add into the list.
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/spec.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /><br>Specification Input</p>
								
								<h4 style="text-align:left">1B. Cookbook</h4>
								<p>When users input a dish that can be cooked/prepared, <b><i>MART-E</b></i> will provide a recipe guide for that particular dish and ask the user if they wish to cook the dish or simply purchase the dish. If users wish to cook the dish for themselves, all the necessary ingredients to cook that dish will be added into the shopping list. But if users just want to buy the dish, that dish will be added into the shopping list for later purchase.
								</p>
													
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/cook.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /><br>Cookbook Input (Cook Option)</p>


													
								<h4 style="text-align:left">2. In-Store Navigation</h4>
								<p> <b><i>MART-E</b></i> has a database of map layouts for both supermarkets and wet markets. So, while shopping in physical stores, users can simply ask <b><i>MART-E</b></i> where a product is, and a digital map will be provided. Not only that, but the user's real-time location will be tracked so as to guide them to the desired destination.
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/realmap.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /><br>Real-Time Location Guiding to Product</p>
								
								<p> But if users already planned out their Shopping List beforehand, <b><i>MART-E</b></i> will provide the shortest possible route within the market users selected to shop in. Not only does this help users traverse new markets, but it also help them to shop quickly and efficiently.
								</p>
													
								<h4 style="text-align:left">3. Price Comparison</h4>
								<p> If users wish to compare the pricing of a specific product amongst different markets, they could simply ask <b><i>MART-E</b></i> to compare the product pricings of a specific product. <b><i>MART-E</b></i> will then provide a table compiled of the locations of markets selling that particular product, and those markets respective selling price.
								</p>
								
								<p> Sometimes, users wouldn't want to buy the cheapest product, but instead would wish to purchase the product in the nearest market for convenience. Because of that, not only are the product sorted by price, but also by distance from the user. 
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/compare.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /><br>Price Comparison of Eggs</p>
								
								<h4 style="text-align:left">4. Suggestions and Promotions</h4>
								<p> Based on the user's Shopping List, <b><i>MART-E</b></i> will suggest other products that the user may like to purchase along with their planned items. <b><i>MART-E</b></i> also provides promotional offers and deals available, so as to keep users updated on products that they could purchase along with their Shopping List.
								</p>
								
								<h4 style="text-align:left">5. Easy Product Registration</h4>
								<p> In order to make products available online for customers to see, shopkeepers and stall owners can simply publish and register their products through <b><i>MART-E</b></i>.
								</p>
								
								<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18RTcN5TLnq5S4IJVVCSmZaHhzpm2tZfD/view?usp=sharing" width="960" height="550"></iframe>
								
								<h4 style="text-align:left">EXTRA. Other Potential Applications of MART-E</h4>
								<p> With <b><i>MART-E</b></i>'s vast database of product information and location layouts, the functionality and applications of <b><i>MART-E</b></i> is way larger than just for accommodating grocery shoppers' needs. With a bit of slight tinkering, this system can be applied for libraries, warehouses, storage facilities, large-scale conventions and much more!

								<h2><u>Contributions</u></h2>
								<p>
									My main contributions towards this project are as followed:<br>
									1. Main Editor and Co-Producer of the Demo Video<br>
									2. Main Scene Director and Plot/Script Co-Writer of Demo Video<br>
									3. Actor and Voice Actor of the Apple Store Manager of Demo Video<br>
									4. Slight Modifications to Hubs Scenes for Demo Video<br>
									5. Co-Creator of Mindmap
								</p>
								
								<h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
								<p>
									From this project, I learnt about how Human-Robot Interaction can make or break the user experience; how the UI and UX of an application can make a software/botkit more compelling for users. I also learnt more about the prototyping procedure and its potential importance in large-scale projects. I also learnt more about coding in Javascript and the platform of Glitch, which I believe would prove useful for future applications. By creating the storyboard, <b><i>MART-E</b></i>'s logo and the video, I've also touched up my video editing and art skills from this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									Apart from the technical skills, I also learnt more about team communication and leadership. I'm glad that we were able to complete our presentation on time for this project, and hope to keep this up for our other projects.
